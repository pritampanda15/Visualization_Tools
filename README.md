The `Visualization Tools` repository, is a collection of resources and tools focused on protein modeling and structural analysis. This folder contains visualizations, models, or scripts that were developed to represent data insights, designs, or analyses visually for bioinformatics projects. The files here may be useful for presenting findings or enhancing understanding of the project data.

## Repository Structure

The repository comprises several submodules, each focusing on different aspects of protein modeling:

- **blender-main**: Offers tools and scripts for visualizing protein structures using Blender, a powerful open-source 3D modeling software.

- **I-PV-master**: I-PV aims to unify protein features in a single interactive figure. It is easy to generate and highly customizable. Data is checked and then plotted. When you publish figures with I-PV, I recommed you also post the files in the datatracks folder as supplementary.
In I-PV is designed to convey complex proteomics information to the audience in an interesting format.
